## Development Notes

### **Philosophy**
This release embodies the core C42 OS philosophy that technology should amplify human consciousness rather than extract from it. Every feature is designed to make users more capable, not more dependent.

### **Technical Approach**
Built with privacy-first architecture, neurodivergent-optimized interface design, and complete transparency. No compromises on user privacy or consciousness amplification.

### **Community**
While currently proprietary for sustainable development, this release includes comprehensive contribution guidelines and a clear path toward open source transition.
